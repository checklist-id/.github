This organization acts as a playground for its members to build for fun, do experimentations,
learning to collaborate, learning to implement new concepts and practices by implementing them
as a part of a cross-platform to-do list app.

Due to its educational nature, things are not expected to always work flawlessly around here,
nor do they expected to look/organized beautifully, nor do they expected to have production-ready grade
quality, so don't expect them to be so ðŸ˜¬

Outside contributors are welcomed, but members are the top priority.
